# nano library

Tiny function library useful for Custom Elements.

![relative sizes](assets/size_matter.png)

Custom Elements depend on bits of the Web Components standard platform itself. Specifically, CustomElements and HTMLImports feature support is expected.

These features are natively available in Chrome, and otherwise supported by [web-componentsjs polyfills](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs). These elements do not depend on ShadowDOM, so [webcomponents-lite](https://polygit.org/components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents.min.js) is sufficient.
